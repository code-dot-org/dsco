# Design System for Code.org (DSCO)

This repository translates our design system to code and publishes the corresponding styles and React components as independent NPM packages. It's "dsco\_" because "dsco" wasn't available as an NPM organization :)

Visit [our Storybook](https://code-dot-org.github.io/dsco_/) to see interactive visual representations of the components published from this repository.

See [our contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to set this repository up locally and make a contribution!
